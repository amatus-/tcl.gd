    * Export 

2005-11-22 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-tclgd@sc.com>

    * Fix minor memory leak where tclgd_channelIOCtx structures weren't
      being freed after writing images to Tcl channels.

    * generic/tclgde.c: Make "handle transparent" return the current 
      transparency color index if no color is specified.  Also when it 
      is specified, require it to be a color number, not that or possibly 
      one of the color aliases.

    * generic/tclgdio.c: Panic if the size written doesn't equal the size
      requested, but since we're using Tcl_Write I don't think that is
      likely to happen.  If it does, we have to panic because GD's
      ioctx stuff doesn't have a way to return an error.

    * mapserver-patches/(README,mapscript-image.i.patch,pkgIndex.tcl.patch): 
      Document and store the patch to Mapserver/Mapscript to allow us to 
      bind one of our tclgd command objects to the gd buffer contained in 
      Mapscript image object.

    * created new tclgd_newGDObjectAttach API for external C programs that
      have a gdImagePtr and want to have a new command object attached to 
      that image pointer that will invoke all of our tclgd magic against it.

    * doc/tclgd_newGDObjectAttach.3: Documentation for the above API.

    * Release version 0.6
