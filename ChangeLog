    * Export

    * Fix minor memory leak where tclgd_channelIOCtx structures weren't
      being freed after writing images to Tcl channels.

    * generic/tclgde.c: Make "handle transparent" return the current 
      transparency color index if no color is specified.  Also when it 
      is specified, require it to be a color number, not that or possibly 
      one of the color aliases.

    * generic/tclgdio.c: Panic if the size written doesn't equal the size
      requested, but since we're using Tcl_Write I don't think that is
      likely to happen.  If it does, we have to panic because GD's
      ioctx stuff doesn't have a way to return an error.

    * patches/(README,mapscript-image.i.patch): Document and store the
      patch to Mapserver/Mapscript to allow us to bind one of our tclgd
      command objects to the gd buffer contained in Mapscript image object.
