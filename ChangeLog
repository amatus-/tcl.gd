    * Update to Tcl TEA build environment version 3.4.

2005-11-26 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-tclgd@sc.com>

    * generic/tclgd.c: "text_bounds" method was still rendering into the
      target image because we weren't passing a null target image when
      we wanted the bounds.

    * configure.in: Use TEA_ADD_HEADERS([generic/tclgd.h]) to cause tclgd.h
      to get installed into the runtime include directory.  This is needed
      for any C applications that link with tcl.gd, specifically our
      patch to link us up with Mapserver.

    * Release version 0.6

2005-11-25 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-tclgd@sc.com>

    * generic/tclgd.c: Make "handle transparent" return the current 
      transparency color index if no color is specified.  Also when it 
      is specified, require it to be a color number, not that or possibly 
      one of the color aliases.

    * generic/tclgdio.c: Panic if the size written doesn't equal the size
      requested, but since we're using Tcl_Write I don't think that is
      likely to happen.  If it does, we have to panic because GD's
      ioctx stuff doesn't have a way to return an error.

    * mapserver-patches/(README,mapscript-image.i.patch,pkgIndex.tcl.patch): 
      Document and store the patch to Mapserver/Mapscript to allow us to 
      bind one of our tclgd command objects to the gd buffer contained in 
      Mapscript image object.

    * created new tclgd_newGDObjectAttach API for external C programs that
      have a gdImagePtr and want to have a new command object attached to 
      that image pointer that will invoke all of our tclgd magic against it.

    * doc/tclgd_newGDObjectAttach.3: Documentation for the above API.

2005-11-22 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-tclgd@sc.com>

    * Fix minor memory leak where tclgd_channelIOCtx structures weren't
      being freed after writing images to Tcl channels.

2005-11-01 Karl Lehenbauer <karl-tclgd@sc.com>

    * Export
