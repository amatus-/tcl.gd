mapscript-image.i.patch is a patch to Mapserver's mapscript/swiginc/image.i
file to add support for tclgd.  

Also pkgIndex.tcl.patch is need to patch
pkgIndex.tcl so that "package require Mapscript" will do a "package require
tclgd" first.  Failure to apply this patch will result in an undefined
symbol when loading the mapscript shared library.

You apply these patches and rebuild and reinstall the Tcl Mapscript extension, 
and you then have an additional method for mapscript image objects.

package require Mapscript

    $mapImage gdHandle newCommandName

You can now use newCommandName to do all of the usual tclgd magic, and you
are operating on the gd buffer that's part of the Mapserver/Mapscript
image object.  For instance, you can draw lines, write text into the buffer,
merge images into the buffer, and write it to a channel or to memory.

If you delete the new command it will not free the gd buffer out from
underneath Mapscript.
