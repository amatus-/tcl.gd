MAPSERVER/MAPSCRIPT
===================

mapscript-image.i.patch is a patch to Mapserver's mapscript/swiginc/image.i
file to add support for tclgd.  

Also pkgIndex.tcl.patch is need to patch
pkgIndex.tcl so that "package require Mapscript" will do a "package require
tclgd" first.  Failure to apply this patch will result in an undefined
symbol when loading the mapscript shared library.

You apply these patches and rebuild and reinstall the Tcl Mapscript extension, 
and you then have an additional method for mapscript image objects.

HOW TO PATCH
============

cd to your mapserver directory, cd to mapscript

    patch -p0 <.../mapserver-patches/mapscript-image.i.patch

    patch -p0 <.../mapserver-patches/pkgIndex.tcl.patch

HOW TO USE
==========

package require Mapscript

Do whatever map generation stuff you choose.

Eventually you get a mapImage handle by doing something like...

    set mapImage [$map draw]

Now you're ready to attach the gd buffer out of the map image and manipulate
it using tcl.gd...

    $mapImage gdHandle newCommandName

You can now use newCommandName to do all of the usual tclgd magic, and you
are operating on the gd buffer that's part of the Mapserver/Mapscript
image object.  For instance, you can draw lines, write text into the buffer,
merge images into the buffer, and write it to a channel or to memory.

If you delete the new command (rename newCommandName "") it will not free the 
gd buffer out from underneath Mapscript -- we're too smart for that ;-)
