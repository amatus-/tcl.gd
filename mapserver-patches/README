mapscript-image.i.patch is a patch to Mapserver's mapscript/swiginc/image.i
file to add support for tclgd.

You apply this patch and rebuild and reinstall the Tcl Mapscript extension, 
and you then have an additional method for mapscript image objects.

package require tclgd
package require Mapscript

    $mapImage gdHandle newCommandName

You can now use newCommandName to do all of the usual tclgd magic, and you
are operating on the gd buffer that's part of the Mapserver/Mapscript
image object.  For instance, you can draw lines, write text into the buffer,
merge images into the buffer, and write it to a channel or to memory.

BUG: If you delete the new command it will free the gd buffer out from
underneath Mapscript.  This would be bad.  We need to track whether we
allocated the image or not and if we didn't, not free the buffer upon
deletion.
